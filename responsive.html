        A theory is a rational type of abstract thinking about a phenomenon, or the results of such thinking. The
        process of contemplative and rational thinking is often associated with such processes as observational study or
        research. Theories may either be scientific or other than scientific (or scientific to less extent). Depending
        on the context, the results might, for example, include generalized explanations.A theory is a rational type of
